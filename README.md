The hard part with this project is to get the added libraries e.g Webservices such as webdriver and ChromeDriverManager

I used the following pages to get things up and running:

1. Selenium documentation: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/
2. Super simple ChromeDriver download: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqWUC-xWYpA
3. For Kali Linux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67h3IT2lm40
4. Chromedriver Selenium setup:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQW2fjgUJrY
